## Description
The opening literature research is a fundamental part of scientific work which takes oftain a substential ammount of time.  This problem is  further reinforced by the continuously increasing volume of scientific publications [1]. The goal of this work is the development of the basis for an intelligent search engine with the aim of supporting scientific literature research on the topic of COVID-19, providing the user additional information on the topic and the surroundings of the users individual research.

## Features

The scope of the current state of the search engine lies on the processing of given documents provided by the CORD-19 Dataset and both ad-hoc and metadata information retrieval provided by the developed search engine and its web interface. Additional components such as a web crawler for identifying new publications are currently missing but are planned for a later date in order to update the data volume to newer COVID-19 literature and the functionality to use this project as a small scale general purpose scientific search engine.

### Processing:
- Document and inverted index construction
- Keyphrase extraction
- Metadata property graph

### Web-Application:
- **Ad-hoc search:** Retrieve documents based on a given search query using a boolean retrieval model
- **Query level metadata analysis:**
   - Query the statistic of the geographical location of institutions involved in a set of given papers, defined by a previous ad-hoc search request.
- **Document level metadata analysis:**
  -  Analyze the publication statistics of a specified author (currently: number of paper published)
  -  Analyze the publication statistics of a specified institution (currently: number of paper published)


## Quick Start


### Manual Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Mongo DB: https://www.mongodb.com/de
- Neo4j: https://neo4j.com/
- Redis: https://redis.io/

- Python https://www.python.org/
- Node.js https://nodejs.org/


>Note: This section describes the overall requirements (software requirements, databases and datasets) for creating this search engine based on the CORD-19 dataset. Specific requirements for the data processing and the web application frontend and backend are either described in the package.json of the node projects or as pip installation instructions in the .ipynb notebooks component documentations.

#### Default Database Configuration:

|Database|Port|
|---|---|
|Mongo DB|27017|
|Neo4j|7687|
|Redis|27018|

#### Covid Open Research Dataset (CORD-19 <cite>[1]</cite>)

- Download the dataset from one of the following sources:
    - https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge
    - https://www.semanticscholar.org/cord19

- Extract data to /dataset directory (create the directory if not existent). The file structure should be the following after the previous steps:

```

## Roadmap

- Additional processing and extension of document metadata
- Advanced search query processing &rarr; natural language understanding
- Development of an document and database level knowledge graph in order to provide short answers to user given search queries
- Development of a web crawler in order to search for new literature in the area of COVID-19 or new topics
- ...
